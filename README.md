# Loci - the venue finding solution

https://github.com/stemshell/loci

## Problem definition

Currently in the Australian market, there is no centralised way to sell and find venues for hire. For eg, for someone who wants to find a pub to hire a room for a function, there isn't really a better option than to simply call individual pubs, go to them in person, or use their (usually poor) websites.

## Proposed solution

Loci will be a web app where people with venues they want to hire out can make listings, and people looking for a venue can browse through those listings. This potentially makes it vastly easier for both sides to satisfy their needs.

## Ethical considerations

- Safety of users within venue (especially if not a commercial premises).

- Safety of members of community.

- Appropriate behaviour of buyers towards both venue and surrounding community.

## User Stories
